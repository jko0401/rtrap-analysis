# Trap Music Subreddit (r/Trap) Data Project

The r/Trap subreddit is an online community where members share and discuss Trap music, 
a hip-hop influenced music subgenre of electronic bass music. Many referred to 2010 as the 
beginning of the genre but it was 2012 when its popularity exploded as artists like
Baauer, Flosstradamus, and RL Grime gained massive followings.  This project aims to dive deep into the subreddit, 
gather data, and analyze how the music and its community has evolved over the years. 

Please refer to the [r/Trap Essentials List](https://rtrap.org/), an informative guide members of the subreddit created,
for more information about Trap music.
