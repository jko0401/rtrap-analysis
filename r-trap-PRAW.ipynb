      "Trap is a subgenre that originated during the 1990s from Southern hip hop in the Southern United States. It is typified by its ominous sound that incorporate double or triple-time sub-divided hi-hats, heavy kick drums from a Roland TR-808, layered synthesizers, and \"cinematic\" strings. The term \"trap\" initially referred to places where drug deals take place. In recent years it has been incorporated with electronic dance music (EDM) by artists who have remixed and made trap songs with more EDM-like aspects.\n",

The confusion may come from the fact that the term \"trap\" refers to both the electronic varient in this mix and the style of Southern hip-hop/rap from which the electronic variant evolved from.  The original genre has a lot of similar building-blocks (808 hits, sprinkler hi-hats), but the primary focus is the rapping, with lyrics pertaining to drugs and drug-dealing.  There tends to be some crossover since many trap/electronic producers may work with rappers or feature lyric-driven content in their mixes.  Hope this clears some things up!\n",

      "I love RL but i'm not really feeling this track. The production is amazing like always but song itself was kind of a let down. I thought the the build up was fantastic, it had so much tension and hype to it; the disappointment from me is due to the drop, the build up had too much hype behind it that the drop couldn't live up to the enormous build up. I feel like the future bass approach to the drop was the safe predictable approach. This track could have been exceptional if you didn't play it safe with the drop, i would have gone with something very unexpected, music is about taking chances and creating new boundaries. I love RL to death so please don't take this as me shitting on the track. Love you RL, you are one of the pioneers in the game and i know you can produce some amazing stuff!  \n",

      "I respectfully disagree with your opinion. Music, for me, is about creating art that you love, and not trying to force yourself to be different for the sake of being different. Recently in the instrumental hip-hop genre, a lot of musicians have gotten so experimental to one-up the Flume-y artists that rhythm takes a back seat. So much of this \"future bass\" I hear nowadays mainly consists of random noises and sliding off-scale synths that's it's almost become a formula to appease the fan base's expectations of total weirdness. \n",

It's probably not meant to have super complex cord progressions with intense sweeps and stuff . Maybe he's thinking of it differently . These songs go off live and his festival sets are a journey in person . Songs like Golden state, because of you and Aurora are amazing to hear live given when they are played \n",

      "Thank you for being the only other person that doesn't dick ride rl here. I wasn't extremely disappointed about this track because I already knew it would be like most of void and be very mediocre. Long ass buildup for a really uneventful drop. I mean, I get people like it, but it's funny how many unknown bangers get dropped on here daily and get no attention but as soon as rl lifts a pinky people here literally start fangirling and calling him \"daddy\". Sorry, I kind of went off, bring dem downvotes, I know they're coming. \n",
      "To each their own, i respect that. I personally saw that drop coming from a mile away and was hoping he wouldn't do it. it's still a good song none the less, but it just had so much more potential to be a fantastic song in my opinion. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Those chords are pretty dope\n",
      "It definitely a different song. I'm pretty sure his whole album will have this sort of feel based on most of the ID's I've heard. Solo RL song aren't really bangers, they're moody and melodic...thats why I love him.   \n",

      "Risky Tweets?\n",
      "Haha oh man I'm getting old! So many hip-hop albums (and other genres) were about the entire journey through the album, not just the banger singles (although singles were a solid part of the music business long ago as much as they are today)... Liquid Swords, Midnight Marauders, Behind the Front, Black on Both Sides, Labor Days... so many more... albums with a cohesive narrative intentionally woven through the entire album. You're right, some artists still do it today, like Kendrick. But it's a lot less of a thing now than it used to be. Singles still crush though!\n",
      "A big part of it for me is the production value. Sure more unique songs get uploaded here every day, but I'd be extremely hard pressed to find something with better production value that's been uploaded here recently. \n",
      "I just really like his clean and not overproduced style. Every element is necessary plus those vocal samples sound rare as a bitch. Great song great feeling keep the TRAIN MOVING\n",

      "Huge RL fan i've seen him 4 times live and delved into nearly all of his sets to find all that obscure goodness, and that 4th one you've listed is just a you thought, so bad news it's not henry and good news here you go buddy: [Damn Kids - Bombay](https://soundcloud.com/maincoursemedia/damn-kids-bombay)\n",

      "Same, heard Flumes tracks a milli but I disagree aswell. \n",
      "Just the heavy synth drop is like Flume but I woke up wanting to listen to it so I'm probably coming around on it.\n",
      "I'm just saying as a listener.  I've been listening to EDM for 30 years.   I'm not about to give advice on music production.   I would give thoughts on where to move this track to make it unique, simply as a listener that's been heavily into trap and EDM in general for years.\n",

      "I see where you're coming from, but I guess that's where opinion comes in. Herobust is an amazing producer and engineer, I would even say better (in some ways) than RL. His stuff is posted pretty often, given he isn't one of the more lesser known, and the outcome isn't even close to this when his tracks get posted. Also a lot of the lesser known stuff on here is solid gold when it comes to production, but no one takes the time of day to listen because it's not from someone famous or from RL or NGHTMRE. That is where my issue lies. \n",

      "Yeah I feel ya. I'd agree with you that herobust is in rl territory. Rl puts out a lot less music so when he does drop something there is a bigger reaction.  On top of that you just  can't prevent circlejerking in communities like this. Like I bet a lot of people here would say ekali is a top 3 trap producer simply because of the jerk.  \n",
      "interesting and confusing at the same time. thanks for linking me.\n",
      "I agree with you there. Rl doesn't release half as much, which is why I get a bit confused in the fact that it completely blows up when it's usually not that amazing of a track in comparison to some real heat that gets posted here. Don't get me wrong, it's in no way horrible, but it lacks for sure. Therein lies the circle jerk though, and of course it's just my opinion. Thanks for hearing me out there. \n",

I’m fine. I have this mix now so I’m fine. thank you mr grime see you next year.\n",

      "THIS IS THE HALF LIFE 3 OF MUSIC \n",
      "Here’s my review and thoughts:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Feel Free: a top-notch opening track for the album. Feel Free introduces many of the sounds and thematic elements of the album (e.g. bells, unique vocal sampling) with an exciting introduction followed by a tense buildup into a stank-face-inducing drop. This track quickly and stylishly kicks off the album at a clip\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Shrine ft. Freya Riding: one of my favorite tracks on the album. Shrine features a tremendously rich vocal performance from Freya Ridings that nicely accompanies RL’s instrumental. The liberal use of hi-hats behind the vocals leading up to the crescendo of the halftime dnb drop is masterfully executed. The full dnb 2nd drop allows the track energy and melody to really hit its full stride\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Light Me Up ft. Miguel & Julia Michaels: lighter more poppy track, I like it much more in the context of the album than on first listen. Miguel/Julia Michaels’ vocals create complimentary vocal textures against both the strumming guitar and bell synths. The Jack U/Diplo drums before the chorus add some nice detail and depth to the track\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Undo Me ft. Tory Lanez: through and through bedroom banger. Tory Lanez delivers seductive verses interspersed with a drop that is simultaneously playful and electrifying. While the synths are designed differently than the previous track, the string and block synths provide an effective hook from Light Me Up and maintain continuity while avoiding the danger of a same-sounding track\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Take It Away: a triumphant future bass x hip-hop banger with large, exuberant chords on the drop. The track builds an undercurrent of tension until the final synth layers enter in the last drop and beg, perhaps intentionally, for RL to “take [the album] away”\n",
      "\n",
      "6. OMG ft. Chief Keef & Joji: one of my least favorite tracks on the album largely due to Joji’s generic auto-tuned performance. While RL delivers a simple but intriguing beat and melody, the track suffers without a strong, leading vocal performance to capitalize on the instrumental\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Shoulda: a nearly atmospheric track, the chiller synths are juxtaposed against a lowkey energetic drum line. In some ways, this track really reminds me of some of Zeds Dead’s work on Northern Lights; its airy, almost celestial synths create a smooth ceiling over tension-inducing, pulse-raising snares\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Reims: while this track has been out of over a year, it necessitates revisiting in the context of the album. RL here shows intensely addictive future bass at its peak: fast, high energy saws and crooning vocal chops on the drop against a gorgeous cinematic backdrop. Few future bass tracks feature the patience and dedication to exposition and buildup of tension leading up to the release at the drop, and here RL shows how to do it properly\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Pressure: contrasting the brightness of Reims, Pressure is the dark, brooding RL that many love best. RL and BN completely annihilate the listener with a heavy electro synth laser beam that nearly knocks you senseless. The vocal samples in the breakdown and buildup are eerie and serve to simultaneously contrast and heighten the creepy atmosphere. On the album version we get the full glory of the 2nd drop synth before the laugh sample. This track is a masterpiece of production\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Era: perfectly placed behind Pressure to continue the dark, tense atmosphere the middle of the album creates, Era is, as many have noted, Core 2.0. The drop is wild with an exhilarating vocal sample providing its introduction. The Middle-Eastern/Egyptian inspired bridge melody and powerful “wailing” vocals maintain tension and a mysterious atmosphere before we are blown away by a fake drop into a full dnb drop. RL here shows he’s not afraid to cross and experiment with genres and nails the execution\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Run For Your Life (Interlude): beautiful harp synths and melody for an interlude are contrasted against a deep humming sample for an extremely satisfying interlude track. RL’s infusion of symphonic elements into electronic Beats is masterful; the intense emotionality makes me want to see RL compose a fully orchestral piece because of its beauty\n",
      "\n",
      "12. I Wanna Know: the intro perfectly hooks in the Interlude’s orchestral elements while introducing Daya’s excellent vocals. The melody behind the vocals in the drop repeats ad infinitum from the start of the track to the finish, but builds across a variety of synths and elements to provide a beautifully continuous backdrop while creating texture and energy variety. This is a pop-edm crossover track executed at the highest level\n",
      "\n",
      "13. UCLA: an interesting fusion of lighter poppy sounds and future bass elements with brass on the drop. While the instrumental production is fine, 24hrs’ lyricism leaves much to be desired\n",
      "\n",
      "14. Rainer: this track’s long slow-rising intro provides only a small breather before RL’s powerful, energizing drums enter. The drops are relentless and frenzied and position Rainer as a fantastic penultimate track for Nova with an urgent melody\n",
      "\n",
      "15. Atoms: in a near perfect homage to the album title, Atoms begins with a slow, smooth and gorgeous vocal performance accompanied by interesting vocal samples and eventually a confident drum line. Evoking the triumphant beauty of a supernova’s aftermath, Atoms creates an emotionally stirring outro to the album with a sense of closure\n",

      "tl:dr: Awesome album. Love the flow between moods and atmospheres between tracks although it can be a bit janky at times in that aspect. The production is top notch and there are plenty of fantastic vocal performances on here despite there being some ones that fall flat. Overall, I’d give this album an 8/10, it’s probably my favourite album of the year so far and I definitely see it growing on me more with more listens. My favourite songs on it are Pressure, Era, Shrine, Take It Away and Undo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feel Free: Love the airy chimes in the intro. The contrast between it and the wonky drops was really neat to me. Solid intro all around. 7.5/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Shrine: The DnB influences on this track were a really nice touch. The vocals are super soulful too. The glistening drops and melody have such a fantastic sense of euphoria to them. 8.5/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Light Me Up: Enjoy the vocal performances on this a lot, especially from Miguel. The drops were a bit forgettable to me upon my first couple of listens, but the have really grown on me. I think it’s the combination of them with the vocals overtop of them that really make the track for me. That and hearing it in the context of the album really made it for me. 7/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Undo: The tribal pluckiness of the drops has stuck with me since first hearing this track. I wasn’t a fan of the lyrics and vocal performances at first listen, but after repeat listens, they’ve really grown on me. I also love the breakdown and buildup to the final drop. Reminds me a lot of Travis Scott’s work. 8/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Take It Away: This track is pretty similar to Light Me Up in terms of structure to me, but the drops have much more power to them. The track has this awesome triumphant feel to it. The vocals in the beginning and the hook are super catchy as well. The final drop that incorporates the whiney synths from the beginning was a great way to close out the track too. 8/10\n",
      "\n",
      "OMG: The percussion on this track immediately stuck out the me. It has this aggressive energy to it. The vocals were a bit generic to me however, so I’m disappointed in that aspect. The instrumental in general is solid, just disappointed that it doesn’t have solid bars or vocals to support it. 6/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Shoulda: Really interesting change of pace from the rest of the album. Did not expect a garage influenced track to be on here. It reminds me a lot of RL’s earlier work. It has this cool nocturnal vibe to it. However, all that being said, I don’t see myself revisiting this track outside the context of the album. The way it transitions into Reims is super cool tho. 6.5/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Reims: Still a fantastic future bass song. The wavey intro, tribal percussion and shimmering drops are just quality future bass all around. 8/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Pressure: God this track is a monster. Easily my favourite song RL has done since Core. The abrasive and apocalyptic drops are so massive, especially on a good sound system. The eerie breakdowns and buildups have a sense tension to them that I haven’t heard from a song in a long time. I also appreciate that he edited the last drop to have the “duh-duh-duh-duh” sounds as well as the coughing. I’ll never forget hearing this track for the first time. 9.5/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Era: Fucking adore the intro to this track. It’s so cinematic and carries on the mood set by Pressure terrifically. The samples from The Prodigy are a nice touch too as I’m a huge fan of that group. The percussion on this too also really sticks out to me. Love the melody of the drops and the DnB switchup at the end too. It’s clear that this track is meant as a follow up to Core and while it doesn’t beat Core for me, it does come close to matching it. 9/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Run For Your Life (Interlude): Usually not a fan of interlude tracks in EDM albums, They’re never really done well imo. But, this interlude is quite gorgeous on its own, despite the transition in mood from Era into it being quite janky imo. It messes with the flow of the album. If it was placed elsewhere in the album I think I would’ve enjoyed it more. 6/10\n",
      "\n",
      "I Wanna Know: Easily my favourite poppy future bass track of the year so far. Everything about this track is the perfect blend of catchiness and emotion. The melody has been stuck in my head ever since first hearing it. Daya’s vocals are fantastic as well. 8/10\n",
      "\n",
      "UCLA: Really not a fan of the vocals or lyrics on this, but the drops and instrumental is quite solid. It has that same triumphant feeling that Take It Away had for me but with weaker vocals all around. 6.5/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Rainer: Such a mysterious and atmospheric vibe to this track. It’s like Reims’ more grandiose and cinematic cousin. The drops have a ton of energy to them too. I wish they were longer, especially the last drop, but they are still quite interesting. 7/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Atoms: Really like the vocals on this. The track has a sentimental and introspective feel to it. I like how it lets the vocals sit and soak in before going into the cinematic and anthemic hook. The track overall is solid closer to the album. But like with Shoulda, I don’t see myself returning to it outside the context of the album. 7/10\n",
      "just here for the karma\n",
      "Idk this feels very safe to me. Pressure really pushes it but everything else is a little forgettable but could be off\n",

      "5. Run For Your Life\n",
      "\n",
      "Honorary Mention: Feel Free\n",
      "\n",
      "That was straight up the most diverse album I've ever heard in my life. Good shit Henry\n",
      "Gave this album a few listens and I gotta say with how many years we waited I'm disappointed. I literally heard Stay for It 3 years ago at a festival and several of these tracks I've heard numerous times over the past year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guess I'll look out for the next RL album in 2025.\n",
      "I felt every human emotion possible while listening to this all the way through. You’re a legend Henry ❤️\n",
      "On a real note guys, this sub has over 80,000 subscribers and it would be 0 if this man, aka our God, aka the GOAT from Los Angeles California, RL GRIME had never graced us with his power. Tonight he gives us new commandments to follow and preach and to chant proudly at festivals for years to come. \n",
      "Just finished listening a couple hours later than most of you. Props to RL as I think he has set a new standard for anyone in the semi-newly popular future bass/trap hybrid genre. I'm in love with a few songs and think I'll be playing Rainer for years to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, I'm a little disappointed. I was hoping for a few more songs I'd call bedroom bangers like Undo, Pressure, and Feel Free are. I had a feeling after I Wanna Know and Reims (almost a year ago damn) that NOVA wasn't going to go quite as \"hard\" as VOID did. Just a little salty Feel Free is the only trap banger we hadn't heard yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a great album, but it's not the album I wanted. Props to you RL regardless of my disapointment, as I truly think it's a fantastic piece of work. A companion album with GTA ID would complete NOVA as both a continuation of RL as the god of r/trap and his evolution as an artist IMO.\n",
      "I literally yelled \"OH FUCK\" as soon as I saw this on my frontpage. The day has finally come, WE'RE FUCKIN EATIN FAM🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥\n",
      "It's a great album no doubt, but is anyone else feeling just slightly disappointed? \n",
      "I guess I was hoping for more bangers on here. However I'm glad to see Henry taking a different route on his music\n",
      "It's finally here, this is a historical thread!\n",
      "http://i.imgur.com/j0UA1y9.png\n",
      "Rainer got me cryin because of how good it is\n",
      "Just gonna put this one out there, but Rainer sounds fairly similar to Free from the Flume’s skin album. \n",
      "Love 90% of Nova and have been waiting as long as you boys but just thought I’d throw this out there as maybe there’s a reason for this that I don’t know about?\n",
      "I really can’t believe it’s finally out. This is such a surreal feeling for me. After following the hype and all the teasers for this release for literally years, it’s just so crazy that it’s finally out. And it’s everything I hoped for\n",
      "Time for trap arms in the cubicle once again! \n",
      "I am almost all the way through with the album. I just got through all the comments in this post. I think I’ll go back through and upvote everything while I finish listening! Can’t wait for the vinyl to show up on my doorstep!\n",
      "Shoulda is Julia part 2 and I fucking love it \n",
      "Atoms has me crying in the club rn\n",
      "Honestly if RL is happy with the Album himself, then we praise him for that. He put in the work and created something that he’s connected to.\n",
      "He didn’t have to put out NOVA, but he choose to for the fans that support him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prim sample in feel free is fucking everything\n",
      "Now that I’ve accepted that it’s not gonna be a trap heavy album I actually fucking love it, and each time I listen, his versatility just continues to impress me more and more. Great album. \n",
      "does anyone else do a full album listen through car speakers (cruise/blunt/alone/i live in LA so an hour is a normal commute anywhere) + then do another listen through good quality headphones? one of my favorite things to do, especially with anything henry related.\n",
      "shoulda emitting julia vibes\n",

      "I like the high polish of his production but to be honest, the drums really don't do anything for me, tracks such as Shrine don't have any oomph to me \n",
      "\n",
      "Plus, this album is all over the place in a way that makes it sound like a random collection of singles (yes there are transitions but they do not make up for a cohesive feel in my opinion) \n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas VOID had, despite my disliking for the individual tracks, a strong sense of cohesion and aesthetic, this feels so much more generic and like a check-list: \n",

      "Goddamn this album is so good it gets better every time I listen to it. This album is so large scale & has a huge variety of tracks, which are mostly all good\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick thoughts on each track:\n",
      "1. Feel Free - really cool track, I really like the Oriental/nature intro & how it kinda fakes you out into thinking it's a future bass style track. Sounds like it could've been a collab with Baauer & What So Not\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Shrine - awesome song, the vocal performance is so powerful\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Light Me Up - not my favorite but also not bad. It's got a good flow/rhythm. Sounds like a Jack Ü demo (which it pretty much is)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Undo - great song, really like the wavyness of this, you can hear Diplo's influence on this \n",
      "\n",
      "5. Take It Away - good song but it sounds pretty interchangeable with his other future bass singles (Aurora, Reims, Stay For It). Doesn't sound like anything new.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. OMG - whip anthem. Such a dirty beat, the 808 is sick & joji & chief keef work really well on here\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Shoulda - really good track, liking it more than I did before\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Reims - we know what this is, I also like it more than I did earlier\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Pressure - same thing here, monster of a track, I wish the dundundundun was more consistent though\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Era - same here, just a massive track with every element sounding like it's turned up to 11\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Run For Your Life - absolutely beautiful, I can imagine this & I wanna know (especially the transition between the 2) is what falling in love feels like.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. I Wanna Know - I was pretty indifferent to this when it first came out but now I'm in love with this track\n",
      "\n",
      "13. UCLA - weakest track for me, it's not bad but it feels like it doesn't belong here. Vocals don't help either\n",
      "\n",
      "14. Rainer - incredible track, been waiting for this one since the tour. Love the old school Euro dance feel to this\n",
      "\n",
      "15. Atoms - another beautiful track, great closer to the album. Sounds like it could've been a collab with him & Cashmere Cat & Hudson Mohawke\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall this is an awesome album & definitely in my top 5 of the year. I do feel that the delays made it less enjoyable though because some of the best tracks on here are the ones that have been out for a while, and it did kill most of my anticipation going in. It would've been so much better to hear them on here for the first time. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the album & I'm glad he took his time to make it as good as he could.\n",

      "Track by track impressions:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Feel Free - Great intro to the album, love the really serene sounding into juxtaposed with the glitchy darkness of the drop.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Shine - Not a bad track at all but it feels very empty to me, the track could do with a nice heavy bassline. I feel like double dropping this with another heavier D&B tune and switching the basses would work really well.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Light Me Up - Nothing that special but it’s grown on me since the first listen. Generic but the production is really nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Take it Away - I LOVE Ty Dolla Sign’s verse on this but the drop is disappointing. If the drop was a bit harder hitting and darker this would be top 3 on the album for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "* OMG - Joji sounds really weird on this and a lot of the lyrics are kind of bad “**i just fucked another freak ay, doing donuts on a quad**”. The beat is dope though, overall I like this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Shoulda - RL Grime making wave music, that’s what I like to hear. One of my favourites on the album and it’s got that distinctive RL sound which is missing from a lot of the album. Also I love how it flows directly into...\n",
      "\n",
      "* Reims - This track still gives me goosebumps every time. One of the best on the album and one of my favourite RL grime tunes ever. \n",
      "\n",
      "* Pressure - My favourite tune on the album tied with Reims. So glad that the second drop is how it is, much prefer that to the cough. Was not expecting that on first listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Era - Still love this track. Not as good as the last two but this is what this album needed. It’s a banger, not much else to say really.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Run For Your Life - I actually really fucking like this interlude. I hope to hear some remixes of this because the main piano melody is beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "* I Wanna Know - This one has grown on me a lot. Love the vocals, I just wish those horns in the background of the mix were a little more prominent.\n",
      "\n",
      "* UCLA - Not a fan of this one. The beat is decent but I hate the rapper on this. Just sounds like a dollar store Post Malone.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Rainer - Love this track. Really reminds me of Free by Flume. Maybe I won’t be bumping this all the time but in the context of the album it’s amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Atoms - Kind of indifferent on this one. Vocals are nice but the track doesn’t really go anywhere. It’s fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I’m feeling a solid 7 on this album, maybe 7.5. Most of the really good tracks are the singles with a few exceptions. I think it’s very very slightly better than VOID. \n",
      "Grime season 3 months early this year boys\n",
      "where's stay for it?\n",
      "RL Grime will always have a special place in my heart. He was the first rave I went to back in 2014. Have loved him since\n",
      "Did anyone else here experience The Antarctic Dome at Coachella this year? Listening to Run For Your Life (Interlude) kind of brings back those feels which was amaaaazing.\n",

      "I went into this album trying not to have expectations, and man I’m really fuckin loving it. Left my house a half hour early so I can sit in the parking lot at work and listen in my car. Solid work imo.\n",

      "Feel Free is good and every song after is underwhelming imo, with maybe one exception.\n",
      "Good album overall, was't face-melting but enjoyed the whole thing.  A little disappointing in the static used at 2:36 (OMG) and 2:28 (Rainer).  Previously had believed RL not using that type of stuff was partly what separated him from garbage/hacky trap producers :P\n",

I feel like RL lost his edge, at least for me personally. Plus the production becomes diluted with all of the production credits. I thought I would be hype over some of the features but many of these tracks are just meh, wouldn't really give them a second listen. Even Feel Free is just meh to me, like the production and the sounds are *amazing* but the idea is dated and too repetitive for me. My top songs off this album have literally already been released: Pressure, Era, and Reims. Maybe seeing this album live would change my mind, but VOID still remains #1 in my heart.\n",
      "Nah not at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I finally listened to it just now. It's bland, generic. No part of the album is offensively bad, no part of the album is incredible. It's the definition of a 5/10, there isn't a single song that I heard and said \"oh shit I need to add this to my playlist right now\"\n",
      "\n",

I think it's just not what I was expecting at first, when an album takes that long to come out it from an artist you admire so much it can never live up to how good you've made it seem in your head  \n",

      "The album isn’t even that good. People are freaking out about Feel Free but the drop is legit one fucking synth the entire time that just gets pitched up an octave and rhythmically changed slightly in the second drop. I swear Henry could produce straight trash and many on this sub would still call him the GOAT. \n",
      "Yes yes we are out here \n",
      "I look at this album as the opposite of VOID. Not in a critical way, but in a stylistic way. NOVA is very bright, hopeful, and allows the listener to lose themselves in the melody rather than the rhythm. VOID was a very dark, brooding, and aggressive LP that made you lose yourself in a different way. Say what you want, but i'd much rather listen to NOVA on cycle while relaxing and having a good time with friends. If i'm chilling with friends and we're all drinking and getting fucked up, VOID would be the better play. It's never a bad thing when an artist tries a different direction. I highly doubt his next album will be filled with tracks like \"Light Me Up\". But who knows, he might make top 40 with one of these and continue to run with the sound- which that will be the death of OG RL. \n",

      "I understand where you’re coming from 100% and I had that same sentiment too a few month back but frankly I think with the context of his letter to the fans about being depressed it makes sense that he would want to focus on something to communicate that with us and his journey out of depression. I think the album communicates that very well. Yes, I love my trap arms flailing and I love me some bangers but I am glad that he has finally released an album that was a culmination of emotions that were inside of him for years. I suspect that following the release of this and the end of his residency in Las Vegas that he will take a break for a bit to relax. We know for a fact that he reads this subreddit so I can only imagine what it’s like for him to read his biggest fans criticisms. I am sure we will get more bangers, and I can guarantee that he will make a return to that style of producing and performing in the future, but for future album releases, I am definitely fine with this direction. Keep in mind that it’s going to be incredibly difficult to topple the standard that VOID set. It has Core, Valhalla and Scylla which are still the gold standard in trap production. It’s hard to beat perfection, but in some ways he definitely did with this album. This album has absurd amounts of emotion on it, something that I felt VOID was lacking, no pun intended, and in place of emotion, RL filled it with bangers.

      "my bad man I just saw this, but my general approach to meeting anyone is if it's before the show, always be respectful and understand they're probably on a time crunch, running around doing a million things (have been on both sides of it so I know what they go through pre show), so assume you'll probably just get a quick \"hey good to see you\" before they have to split to take care of something. but know what they look like and keep an eye out because they won't be backstage 100% of the time, looking for someone with a backpack helps. post show can be easier, they'll usually have more time to say what's up, but think of it like an ama - is there something you've ever wanted to ask this guy/girl, something about an old id or a show they've played? bring it up! I feel like it mixes it up from the standard \"hey man you killed it, great show nice to meet you\" and may even strike up a conversation. I rarely try and ask for pictures, and never ever will backstage, but if the convo's been going on a while and the moment's right then go for it. This is the approach I take when I go to shows, and I know I'm extremely lucky, but I've been able to meet Ekali, Vincent, Oshi, Sober Rob, Deffie, Alexander Lewis, Luca Lush, Dillon Francis, Thomas Jack, Mr. Carmack and others using it - they usually love talking with fans. I know Ekali's show in Brooklyn already passed, but I hope this helps you for future shows!\n",

      "You're absolutely right. The thing is though, it doesn't happen to this degree in other music scenes. For example Rock (be it indie, folk, alternative, metal, etc..) is still a very album-oriented music scene. A majority of small, young bands still take their time to compile a cohesive full-length album and release it in a single package when its ready. Sometimes this takes years. There may be some singles or an EP to hold people over in between, but the artists' main output is focused on long-play releases. \n",

      "Oh for sure, it seems like it's pretty unique to electronic music. I think it may be due to soundcloud taking such a lead role in electronic music. Also I think it's beneficial to always drop singles as a smaller artist cause then hopefully your song will get played in many different mixes as well as played live, in hopes that more people will hear your music and you can gain a larger following.

I guess I just think its pretty normal that most albums in general are not that good, and some small fraction of them are really great. And I don't think that is something unique to today's music.\n",

Most of the more acclaimed artists have as many full-on concepts as many electronic artists have EP releases.

That just doesn't seem like a huge drought of great albums to me. I'd say most of those at least have a consistent sound, but not a consistent concept/story.\n",

I’m hoping flume and g Jones and shades continue to innovate and inspire other producers to do the same kind of work with their ideas though. I think Nova was also clearly trending in that direction.

      "In the most traditional sense a DJ in the middle of a set wouldn't do anything to the original song, they are just mixing from song to song. However, with the equipment present in this video, a decent DJ could cut up a live mashup and a highly skilled DJ might be able to pull off a live 'remix'. A lot of misinformed people conflate the tasks of Djing and music production. \n",
      "In most cases not a whole lot compared to the original song, but while djing he is working the mixer mostly, so he is handling song selection, timing of course, and some volume, eq, and fx work to make the transitions smoother.  With the best djs if you weren't watching them directly and just listening you might not know if they're doing anything at all unless they made a mistake.  The music flow has to be most important, regardless if the dj is actually \"doing\" anything.\n",

In an hour, he mixed not even 30 songs and those that he did lacked the diversity I was expecting - usually I wouldn't have that much trouble with just under 30 songs but the majority of the songs in it are more or less boring and when there's r/trap users that can make mixes using 60+ songs in 30 mins, we should expect something pretty insane from the guy who is the forefront of trap music.

It's themed to what it's about. This is simply a mix with the monicker, Halloween Mix on it. Nothing release balldropping mouth watering about it. Not trying to be a dick. Simply not my thing, but oddly I love trap. Guess I like more of the stuff in the underground rap scene. The stuff you get at a strip club, gentlemen club or ghetto dance clubs. Yada Yada.

      "1) They didn't include the title of the track or the artist.       \n",
      "2 ) They called their own track a \"banger\". That always seems weird to me. Even if you produce a high energy track, I feel like it should be up to other people to decide if it's a banger. A more appropriate title would have been: Finelli - Grime (influenced by Quix and EPROM)      \n",

I can’t say this enough but thank you for everything you do. I have so much respect for you as a producer and DJ. You are and always will be my favorite artist and the sole reason I even got into EDM/raving in the first place. I would not be the same if you and Salva hadn’t remixed What A Shame. \n",
      "\n",
      "My questions for you are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Do you think your influence and any following pressure that may have come with you being a pioneer in the early trap music scene had any affect on why you’ve shifted to a more future bass-y sound and/or why you don’t really release remixes anymore? \n",

What occurred to your artistry and/or life to motivate you to change your artistic direction from being someone shrouded in sonic darkness to someone pursuing brightness? What caused this \"obsessive ideation on growth and on transition\"? \n",

Just wanted to ask if you think you can ever top NOVA? It was my favourite album last year with zero hiccups in it.

      "House and Rock are not genres mostly based on a handful of production techniques.  Like I said, I shoot through here to grab those trap tracks that everyone on this thread is claiming to be tired of/not to like,  because they work in generic clubs just like they work at generic festivals, where this music and the producers you named also play.  I've listened to all of them you listed by the way, and I've heard Bleep bloop, Herobust, and G Jones live.  They all did pretty much what G Jones and everyone on this thread is making fun of, and I just don't see how you would expect anything else.  Believe me, every genre has this problem nowadays because of over saturation, but trap pretty much started out like that.  I know it doesn't sound like it, but I'm not talking as negative as it sounds, more like calling it like it is.  It's all good, and who cares what I think if you're into it and having a good time?  It has it's place.  I'm literally telling you I play it at gigs, and I have plenty of friends that are into it.  I just know that there's a whole wide world of electronic music, and even if you're just into broken beats, trap is like staying in your living room compared to what's out there.\n",

Then Levi got on Twitter and talked the shit he did, so I guess I find it pretty excusable that Bleep was the only one to finally call out Levi by name instead of subtweeting.  Sure, it could've been handled better by everyone involved but I feel like a lot of the popularity that G Jones enjoys comes from bass heads who probably wouldn't take kindly to the picture Levi was painting. Greg couldn't have possibly replied to that in a professional way, so Bleep, Space Jesus, Sayer, and even Ekali weighed in on the situation.\n",

Gladiator, RL, UZ, Brillz, etc. can all be expected to play some mainstream/poplar tracks in their sets, but the overall mix will still feel unique.

      "Levitation, at the end of his set, said some stuff about how \"holleywood attitudes change you\" and stuff, then later that night reiterated his thoughts on twitter.  Come to find out, he was mostly upset because G Jones' tour manager wouldn't let him and his fucked up buddies come party in the green room, thus inspiring him to make some fucked up comments on the mike (I was there) and also talk shit on twitter about one of the (apparently) nicest dudes in the scene.  It was hella weird, I normally don't see (and prefer) stuff like that being aired out on social media\n",
      "What I'm saying, is it's a lot different when DJs drop the same tracks during different sets at the same festival. People will dance because it's a concert and dancing is fun, but by day 3 of any festival a pretty common line to hear is \"fuck this song again?\" I get that it's a DJ set and they have every right to play what they want, but any frat boy with a pair of CCDJs can mix Bad and Boujee with anything with similar BPM. Why be simple, when you can go above and beyond and play something that not only makes people dance, but is original and/or creative? I just came back from lightning in a bottle and it was super refreshing to hear DJs of all genres drop their own tracks instead of spending their entire set trying to please the crowd. \n",

The reason the show was so mild is a bit of a long story but has to do with boring promoter politics - but it was honestly such a nice change. From playing sold out shows and festivals and shit to tonight - I felt no pressure. Which is a feeling I haven’t had in awhile. I was allowed to make mistakes and learn and have fun and it was a super great night, just another person loving music... yeah I had a great night and it makes me happy y’all did too because when you go to a dry, empty college event, all you have is the music to guide your way.. and I was just kinda fucking around and picking out mistakes in my set and reading yalls faces. Brought me right back to playing for nobody at my resident night in Vancouver 3 years ago... most fun I’ve had in awhile. Thank you for the lovely post \n",

We had a blast but after hearing how bad the turn out was a lot of headliners bailed including Downlink, but Ill Gates still came and threw down one of the most fun sets I’ve ever heard to a crowd of like 20 people.

The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these bangers, to realise that they’re not just slappers- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike RL Grime truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the classic horns in RL’s existential trap classic “Core”.

The mixing on the record is obviously up to par as something should be when you have that kind of money, same goes with the mastering. That said would kids go crazy at a fest when its played? Probably, but it just does not hold up to the standards these days, especially for someone who is often referred to as one of the leaders of the trap wave.

      "This might be sacrilegious to say but RL Grime as a producer is not the most innovative out there anymore. He helped bring about the trap sound we know and love and his songs are classic, quality bangers but never really the most innovative thing out there. He's good for producing clean-sounding tracks, which a lot of us enjoy. I know that I was getting tired of a lot of over-produced songs these days where the producer tries to cram in too much in one track. \n",
      "\n",
      "A big reason that a lot (if not most) of us love him is his live shows. He puts a lot of effort into his sets and his production and it shows. You can tell he develops a lot of his tracks with his sets in mind. I was iffy on Reims at first, but then I saw him open with it in his sets a couple times and realized the major effect it had on me live vs. just hearing it alone. Surely Era will go off live.\n",

      "\n",
      "the best word i can use to describe this song is organic. \n",
      "\n",
      "e- also i just wanna say that producers like rl grime, baauer, hudmo, lunice, salva, rustie, etc are all producers who sit on tracks. they don't put shit out very much and put the time in to make sure that their projects are all stellar. the current wave of soundcloud producers don't do that at all and you can hear the difference.\n",
      "I 100% agree\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2nd half is far better than the first, so there is an argument there for the quality of the song, but as far as the first half goes its pretty bland and outdated\n",
      "I'm pretty objective to everything RL puts out, and this does feel like one of his more festival-y songs that you SHOULD release as a single for your album. It's designed to get people hype, which is exactly what it's doing. You could say the same thing about Core... as a PRODUCER, it's just an egyptian horn sample over an tight mix drums that only money can buy, like you said. Imo, that doesn't stop Core from being a long lasting banger and staple in trap dj sets... a style which is nearly built on hype and bass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously Void has bangers that are a little more unconventional like Danger and Monsoon, but he didn't reveal those til album release. And there's some great stuff on Void that isn't a banger... but it's a good song (like Vault, which is one of his most underrated songs of all time...).\n",
      "\n",
      "So I think Era is a good song for what it is in the moment, and whether I think it'll be a good song in the future... who knows, but it doesn't stop me from liking it right now.\n",
      "can we make this the r/trap copy pasta 🤣\n",
      "It's not gonna be as big as core. But it still is gonna get me up and hyphy. With the drum and bass breakdown it could be used in different parts of his sets, whereas core is usually used at a climax point. \n",
      "it's pretty disappointing that this comment is being downvoted when it's just a different opinion from the majority of the circlejerkers here. I agree with you, nothing about this track really stands out or is revolutionary. I definitely liked the buildup but I thought the drop was just incredibly flat. hoping that the rest of the album picks up the slack because RL Grime is by far my favorite dj and it sucks to have waited 3 years for a product that sounds like any other trap track posted by a soundcloud dj\n",
      "It's core without the vocals...Only a single drop synth (the horn) and it isn't enough on it's own to fill out the drop, although it does sound great. Wish there were some more background sounds to add some 300-800 Hz content to fill it out. I think thats why the second drop sounded a little better to me, dropped the lead an octave and it felt more full.  The third drop, DNB drop, was fucking fire though, lotsa nice harmonics in that 808 and between that and the drums it really filled up the frequency spectrum and made it sound full \n",

That second link is an older post, but in it, apparently GTA and RL Grime went live on Periscope showing off the track. It has since been deleted.

His appeal is so wide because people outside of electronic music fuck with him (shoutout Rihanna using Core in the Fenty ad). Saw Era live and it was a fucking slapper but it wasn't overkill. The combination of horn style lead and a more or less hip hop style of drums appeal to everyone. It's simple and massive at the same time which a lot of artists can't capture.\n",
      "I agree with you. Good song. \n",
      "I created this reddit account to get a discussion going. This song is heavily up-voted and by the look of the comments the hype is real, but is it really a good song? Does it have any staying power? IMO as a producer its super basic; and not in good way where the minimalism is part of the idea. It sounds like a lazy Core 2.0 that is about 2 years out of style... The mixing on the record is obviously up to par as something should be when you have that kind of money, same goes with the mastering. That said would kids go crazy at a fest when its played? Probably, but it just does not hold up to the standards these days, especially for someone who is often referred to as one of the leaders of the trap wave. Again, lets discuss, I'm interested to hear why so many people are stoked on this song (aside from the fact that RL generally gets treated like a god in this subreddit) \n",

      "A song does not have to have staying power to be liked you are right. Good minimalism is hard for me to describe but artists like STWO and Cashmere Cat pop into my head (obviously a different Genre) When referring to 'standards' I meant this -- There is a disgusting amount of music flooding Soundcloud these days, which were all well aware of. I meant it does not hold up to the standards in terms of a unique idea/ fresh sound. Maybe he didn't want it to be a super unique idea and maybe he just wanted it to be a slapper, thats all well and good but it just sounds like lazy production, which is playing it safe for the fest crowd. It sounds like it could have been on the cymatics demo sample pack tbh...\n",
      "On top of what he said, I'd also add that minimalism is keeping it simple because adding things would take away from the integrity of the sound. On the opposite end, an empty sound occurs when the sound doesn't hold up on it's own, and needs instruments added to it.\n",

Not every WAV is equal, not every 320 is equal. I could take something at 92 KBPS and rebounce it as a WAV. does that make it a lossless audio file? Fuck no. Who knows how many times it' been downconverted/upconverted etc. Just because you downloaded a rip on /xtrill and its a 128 and it sounds bad doesn't mean 128's sound bad. Just because the apple I bought was rotten doesn't mean all apples taste awful. Basically if I listen to a song and it sounds good, I will play it. People knock me for playing 128's and I'm just like... If I can't tell the difference, then neither can you. And the bit about playing it on big systems and it sounding like shit is also a load of crap. TL;DR: If it sounds good on good headphones, play it. (That said, anything below 128 and you will notice audio quality deteriorate VERY quickly.)\n",

      "Only critique I'll give is that you really need to EQ the drums at the very least; there's a massive amount of clashing with the midrange frequencies. Basically, when mixing, you want to think of things as having their own regions primarily; drums sit in low/mid/high region (kick/toms and snare/hats and cymbols usually), synths the same depending on your bass etc, so on and so forth. You want to basically \"scoop out\" a bit of the frequencies of the synths/keys you're using to put this really simply from your drums so that you're not having frequency clash and each part can properly sing out.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's definitely way more in depth than that, but if you basically work on EQing (you can use the built in one in Ableton even) you can get those drums to sound better in the mix without even having to do anything else. \n",
